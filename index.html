        <p class="experience-about">I am 30. I have been doing internet marketing for the last 8-9 years. I have wanted to learn programming for a long time, but it never came to that. In 2019, I started watching YouTube videos and reading articles, but it was all without practice. In 2020, in the midst of a pandemic, I found a course from Glo Academy on the Internet and began to study it. I went through all the lessons on HTML and CSS, I never got to JS, because there was no free time. After that, he postponed his studies for more than 1 year, and in December 2021 he decided to finally bring this matter to its logical conclusion. Unfortunately, due to the main work, there is practically no time and effort left, but there is motivation and desire. In the future, I want to help RS school with training.</p>

        <p class="experience-text">No programming experience. Little knowledge in html and css as well as Git and GitHub. English - A2.</p>
